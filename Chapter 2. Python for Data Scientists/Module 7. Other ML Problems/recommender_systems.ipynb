    "# Introduction: Simple Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "__Recommender systems__, also referred to as __recommendation systems__, are filtering systems used by many different companies world-wide to be able to recommend products (e.g. movies, clothes, etc) based on user preferences. Unlike __ranking algorithms,__ recommender systems aim to provide recommendations without an explicit input from the user (such as a search query). We obviously cannot recommend _exactly_ what a user wants as we cannot access or process all the information in their brain at the same time. Instead, we can take advantage or users' past ratings, choices and preferences to __predict__ the products the user will most probably like.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do these systems do what they do? This is question that has become a large topic of research and the current answer is that there are mutliple ways to create recommender systems: each working under different assumptions and algorithms. There are two main broad classifications that we will cover shortly: __content-based recommendation__ (item-centred) and __collaborative filtering__ (user-centred).\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we cover the implementation of these, we will cover what is informally referred to as a simple recommender system: a system that uses the weighted average rating from all users to make recommendations on the \"best\" options. This is also referred to as a type of __demographic recommender system.__ Throughout this notebook, we will use the \"Movies Dataset\" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset), where the full version contains information on over 45,000 movies with 26 million ratings from  270,000 users. We will be using the small version, as shown below:"

    "Great, so now we have the top charts. This chart can be carried further to become a simple recommender system by recommending the top movies in the charts to all users. Is this a good recommender system? Not particularly. By taking a global weighted average we are able to determine which ones are considered the best on average, but we are unable to account for the individual preferences of the users. For instance, if I was a fan of exclusively Romcoms, I would be recommended only movies I dislike from the list above. The same would happen to people who really don't like action and thrillers. Therefore, we must use our data to instead be able to account for individual preferences! Therefore, simple recommender systems like this that generate global recommendations are generally only used for users who the system has collected little data from.\n",

On the other hand, online evaluation enables us to capture aspects of the performance of our system that offline methods cannot.

    "# Content-based Recommenders\n",
    "We can now begin to understand the first sub-class of recommendation systems: __content-based recommenders.__ Let us look at the recommendation problem in the context of our movies dataset. It is intuitive to say that we would like to recommend romance movies to someone that has rated other romantic movies highly as opposed to action, or to recommend older films to users to who are fans of old classics, or even Batman movies to a Batman fan. In this context, we are looking at the characteristics (content) of each movie, and recommending movies that are similar to the previously highly rated movies by the same user. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple approaches for the machinery of content-based recommenders. Most will either use the features of movies to predict whether you like or dislike a movie (classification) or to predict the rating the user would give to a movie they have not yet seen (__model-based__). Some might even use the features of a movie you have just watched and recommend the most similar movies to that given movie given their respective features (__memory-based__). We will be creating our own algorithm to predict the ratings of unseen movies and recommend those that are rated the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modelling terms, we can frame the problem of recommendation as using the __features__ of movies watched by a user and the ratings given to each movie to __predict__ the rating the user would give to a movie not yet watched based on the movie's features. This is why this approach is referred to as item-centred. In other words, if we have enough data, we train a model for each user based on the previously watched movies and their features. The features we have chosen to use in our model are given genres, vote average, release date and runtime. While release date and vote average are available, we have to extract and process the genres for each movie. Given that we have a list of genres for each movie, we will have to dummy encode it as follows:\n",
    "- Determine how many genres there are and make each genre a feature of the model\n",
    "- Assign to each genre a zero if it is not present in the movie's list of genres, or 1 for each genre given each movie "

    "From the evaluation metrics, we can see that the prediction made by our model deviates on average by 0.63 from the true rating, which is not a large deviation, and is generally able to distinguish between 'okay', 'great' and 'terrible' movies in the opinion of the user. However, if we would like to recommend 10 movies out of roughly 45,000, our rating predictions need to be even better. Therefore, this model may serve as a strong baseline model that can be improved by accounting for other features such as cast, directors, plot, amongst others.\n",

    "As you have seen, we only considered users that had reviewed 100 movies or more, as we do not have enough data to accurately train a model for that given user for a large number of features. What happens in the real-world if we need to make recommendations for users who have rated few movies? What if they are a completely new user? This is known as the __cold-start__ problem and makes it so that models such as our content-based one struggle to make recommendations for users whom we have little data on, making it an issue of __data sparsity__. Additionally, this approach requires feature extraction, which can sometimes be cumbersome."

    "The second classification of algorithms we are now going to go over is known as __collaborative-filtering__, which, as the name implies, requires the collaboration of all the different members of our user-base. It works under the assumption that users that have had similar preferences/choices in the past have similar tastes. If Susan and Tom both love the same movies, if Susan loves _He's Just Not That Into You_ then we should probably recommend that movie to Tom! Unlike content-based recommender systems, collaborative filtering does not require any manual feature extraction, hence why it's referred to as user-centred.\n",

    "As before, there are different approaches to how we can create a collaborative filtering system:\n",
    "- We can either look at the preferences/ratings of users who have similar interests and predict the preferences/ratings of this user (memory-based)\n",
    "- We can use the data we have on the preferences/ratings of all users in our dataset to __learn__ and/or __predict__ the features of individual different items and use these features to predict preferences/ratings for given items (model-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have covered the model-based approach in the content-based recommendation section, we will be implementing a memory-based approach for collaborative filtering by using some of the unsupervised learning techniques we have encountered so far in the course. If you are interested in looking into an implementation that uses feature learning, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AP-DgFBNP4&ab_channel=ArtificialIntelligence-AllinOne).\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we will be creating a ratings vector for each user and using a KNN with means algorithm to compute mean rating of the user's $K$ nearest neighbours for movies not yet rated by a given user. We will be using the __Surprise library__, a scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data. Before we use our data we will have to clean it just as in the case for the content-based system. For the Surprise 'cross-validate' method, we need to have our data as three columns in the following order: userId, movieId, rating. "

    "What is this algorithm actually doing? In memory-based approaches with algorithms such as KNN, we generally construct a __user-item matrix,__ as seen in the diagram above. This is a 2D representation of users vs items, such that each row contains all the ratings (and missing ratings) a user gave to every movie. Cells representing movies that have not been rated by the respective users are filled with zeros, NaNs or other placeholders. In the case of this surprise algorithm, they created a __similarity matrix__ containing the measure of cosine similarity between each user pair and uses that similarity as weights when computing the average rating of all its neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most popular frameworks for collaborative filtering algorithms use __matrix factorization__ approaches, which include using a variant of SVD (as SVD cannot be applied to a matrix with missing data), known as SVD++. In fact, this is the algorithm popularized by Simon Funk during the Netflix prize for recommender systems! The theory of this algorithm extends beyond the scope of this course, but you can read more about it [here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2017/1975719/). Luckily this algorithm is also implemented by the Surprise library!\n",

It can also sometimes be difficult to combine and weight the preferences of user neighbors. \n",

    "\n",
    "As the name implies __hybrid systems__ are essentially ensemble models of different recommender systems together. As each approach generally focuses on a different characteristic and suffers from individual limitations, hybrid systems are generally able to give the optimal result. Arguably one of the most successful recommender systems, the one used by _Spotify_, works with this principle. It combines the predictions of the following three key systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collaborative filtering to compare an individual's behaviour to other people's taste\n",
    "2. Natural language processing to analyse the text in each song and find songs of similar lyrics (content-based)\n",
    "3. Audio modelling of songs' raw audio (content-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other recommendation systems, Spotify uses __implicit feedback__ instead of ratings, which are things such as stream count. This first model gives their system a way to recommend songs based on similar users. The NLP and audio modelling content-based models enable the system to find similarities between items with very few streams which would not otherwise be recommended by the collaborative filtering model due to data sparsity. This is how Spotify is able to recommend even relatively unpopular songs based on a user's personal preferences, which is what made their 'Discover Weekly' feature so popular!\n",
